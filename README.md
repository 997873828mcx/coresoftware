# Welcome

This is the core software respository for [sPHENIX collaboration](https://www.sphenix.bnl.gov/). 


Code from the mastrer branch is pulled and build each night (nightly-build) 
and it becomes [part of the default software environment on RCF](https://wiki.bnl.gov/sPHENIX/index.php/Setup#.28At_each_login.29_Run_sPHENIX_login_shell). 
Weekly snapshot of the build is also available as ANA-builds. 
Due to its importance, update of this repository require going through a review via [the "Pull Request" process](https://wiki.bnl.gov/sPHENIX/index.php/GitHub_Coresoftware_Update_Procedures).
